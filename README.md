Rice Grainpalette - Deep Learning: Rice Classification
--------------------------------------------------------

Overview
---------
Rice Grainpalette is a deep learning model designed to classify different types of rice by analyzing input images. This project utilizes a Flask web application to provide a user-friendly interface for image uploads and classification results. The model is built using Python and various libraries for machine learning and image processing.

Features
---------
1. Classifies various types of rice based on user-uploaded images.
2. User-friendly web interface built with HTML and CSS.
3. Real-time classification results displayed on the web page.
3. Accurate and efficient image processing using deep learning techniques.
4. Technologies Used
5. Backend: Python, Flask
6. Frontend: HTML, CSS
7. Machine Learning Libraries: TensorFlow, Keras, OpenCV, NumPy, etc.
8. Other Libraries: Flask-Cors, Pillow, etc.

Installation
-------------
Clone the repository:
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/rice-grainpalette.git
cd rice-grainpalette

Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended):

source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`

Install the required packages:
pip install -r requirements.txt

Usage
------
Start the Flask application:

python app.py

 • Open your web browser and go to http://127.0.0.1:5000.

 • Upload an image of rice and click on the "Classify" button to see the results.

Model Training
---------------
The model was trained on a dataset of rice images. Ensure you have the dataset available in the specified directory.
You can retrain the model by modifying the training script provided in the repository.
